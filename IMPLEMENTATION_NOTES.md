## Known Considerations

### 1. Canvas Animations (script.js)
The existing `script.js` file has canvas animations for "lanterns" and "petals" - these are Chinese-themed. Options:

**Option A: Keep As-Is (Recommended for now)**
- The animations still work fine
- They're abstract enough (just colored particles)
- No functionality is broken
- Can update later if needed

**Option B: Update to Cyberpunk Particles**
- Replace lanterns with geometric shapes
- Update colors to purple/green
- Add glitch effects
- More work but aligns better with theme

**Current Status:** Left as-is (Option A) - works fine with new design

### 2. Font Loading
Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts CDN:
- Inter (primary font)
- JetBrains Mono (monospace)
- Orbitron (display font)

If offline use is required, fonts should be self-hosted.

### 3. Browser Support
**Minimum Requirements:**
- Modern browsers (2020+)
- CSS custom properties support
- CSS Grid support
- backdrop-filter support (degrades gracefully)

**Fallbacks Provided:**
- Font stack has fallback fonts
- Colors work without custom properties (hardcoded as fallback)
- Layouts work without Grid (Flexbox fallback)

### 4. Performance
**Optimized:**
- GPU-accelerated animations (transform/opacity)
- Minimal repaints
- Efficient selectors
- Lazy-loaded images (if any are added)

**Potential Issues:**
- Canvas animations can be heavy on low-end devices
- Consider adding motion reduction media query

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### High Priority
1. **Add Logo Image:** Create an actual SVG logo file (currently CSS-only)
2. **Accessibility Audit:** Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance check
3. **Performance Audit:** Lighthouse score optimization

### Medium Priority
1. **Update Canvas Animations:** Replace Chinese lanterns with cyber particles
2. **Add Reduced Motion Support:** `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
3. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Add theme switcher (currently dark-only)

### Low Priority
1. **Add Loading States:** Skeleton screens for data loading
2. **Add Error States:** Better error handling UI
3. **Add Success/Info Toasts:** User feedback system
4. **Add Sound Effects:** Optional terminal-style beeps

- More professional (cohesive design system)
- Fully responsive (tested breakpoints)

**Next Steps:**
1. Test thoroughly on staging
2. Fix any bugs found during testing
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for issues
5. Consider optional enhancements
